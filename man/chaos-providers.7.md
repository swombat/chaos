# chaos-providers(7)

## NAME

chaos-providers - configure and select LLM providers for FreeChaOS

## DESCRIPTION

FreeChaOS is provider-agnostic. The kernel speaks the Chaos-ABI; adapters
translate that to whatever wire format a given provider expects. New
providers are added through `~/.chaos/config.toml` - no code changes, no
rebuilds.

For the condensed support matrix (bundled IDs, wire formats, OS/CI coverage, clamp backends), see [chaos-support(7)](./chaos-support.7.md).

## BUILT-IN PROVIDERS

FreeChaOS ships with these providers preconfigured:

| Provider | Wire format | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| `openai` | Responses API | Default, hardcoded |
| `anthropic` | Anthropic Messages | Hardcoded; URL-detected |
| `xai` | Responses API | Bundled; native `web_search` / `x_search` tools |
| `zai` | Chat Completions | Bundled; Z.ai pay-per-token (GLM-5 / GLM-5.1) |
| `zai-coding` | Chat Completions | Bundled; Z.ai GLM Coding Plan subscription |
| `charm` | Chat Completions | Bundled via `thirdparty.toml` |

Any other provider — DeepSeek, Groq, Ollama, MiniMax, Kimi, TensorZero,
self-hosted gateways — is a config entry away.

## WIRE FORMATS

Providers speak one of four wire formats:

- **Responses API** — OpenAI's `/v1/responses`. What OpenAI ships and most imitators clone.
- **Chat Completions** — `/v1/chat/completions`. The lingua franca of OpenAI-compatible gateways.
- **Anthropic Messages** — Anthropic's native format. Auto-detected when the base URL contains `anthropic`.
- **TensorZero** — TensorZero's native `/inference` endpoint. Opt in with `wire_api = "tensorzero"`.

By default, providers use `wire_api = "auto"` — FreeChaOS tries Responses
first and falls back to Chat Completions on 404/405/501. The winning
format is cached for the session.

You add a `[model_providers.<id>]` block, set your API key in the
environment, and go.

## EXAMPLES

### OpenAI ChatGPT context window

For GPT-5.6 Sol, Chaos uses the context window advertised by the provider
catalog by default:

```toml
chatgpt_context_window = "catalog"
```

The ChatGPT OAuth route has also been observed accepting more context than its
catalog advertises. Users who prefer the experimentally observed window can
opt in:

```toml
chatgpt_context_window = "observed-400k"
```

You can also persist either choice from the TUI:

```text
/context-window catalog
/context-window observed-400k
```

Run `/context-window` or `/context-window status` to show the active preset.
Changes made through the command apply to newly started Chaos sessions.

For `gpt-5.6-sol` on the built-in OpenAI provider, this selects a 400,000-token
window and automatic compaction at 350,000 tokens. It does not change other
models or providers. The provider may change its accepted limit independently
of Chaos, so `catalog` remains the default.

The lower-level numeric settings remain available for advanced use:

```toml
model_context_window = 400000
model_auto_compact_token_limit = 350000
```

An explicit `model_context_window` disables the named preset. An explicit
`model_auto_compact_token_limit` overrides the preset's 350,000-token
compaction point.

As a context window approaches automatic compaction, Chaos emits a durable
`compaction_pending` event once for that pressure window. The TUI shows the
remaining token count, active token count, configured compaction threshold, and
hard context window. The warning begins when the session enters the reserve
band between the automatic compaction threshold and the hard context limit. It
does not itself change or defer compaction.

Users can opt into a bounded plaintext operational checkpoint before automatic
compaction:

```toml
compaction_checkpoint = true
```

When enabled, Chaos asks the active model to record the task in progress,
promises, incomplete work, verification state, next action, uncertainties, and
important provenance. The result is capped at 8,000 tokens, persisted as a
developer-instructions item, and reinjected into both local and remote
replacement history. If a compaction attempt fails, Chaos reuses the checkpoint
for that pressure window rather than requesting another one. The checkpoint is
separate from personal journaling or semantic memory. If checkpoint creation
fails, Chaos shows a warning and continues with the safety-required compaction.

Before automatic compaction starts, Chaos flushes the canonical journal and
records a durable `CompactionStarted` marker containing the final
pre-compaction sequence boundary. A failed durability check pauses
soft-threshold compaction; only a hard-context-limit emergency may continue
without the confirmed boundary.

### xAI (Grok)

Bundled — no config needed. Just export the key:

```bash
export XAI_API_KEY=xai-...
chaos --provider xai --model grok-4
```

URLs containing `x.ai` automatically expose xAI's native `web_search` and
`x_search` server-side tools — no function schema needed. Override the
bundled config by redeclaring `[model_providers.xai]` in your
`~/.chaos/config.toml`.

### Anthropic (Claude)

Already built-in, but you can override its config:

```toml
[model_providers.anthropic]
name = "Anthropic"
base_url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
env_key = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
chaos --provider anthropic --model haiku
```

The URL contains `anthropic`, so FreeChaOS routes to the Messages API adapter.
For the official Anthropic endpoint, five-minute prompt caching is enabled by
default. Set `CHAOS_ANTHROPIC_CACHE_TTL=1h` for the extended TTL or
`CHAOS_ANTHROPIC_CACHE_TTL=off` to disable caching. A request-level
`anthropic_cache_ttl` extension (`5m`, `1h`, or `off`) takes precedence over
the environment variable.

### TensorZero

```toml
[model_providers.tensorzero]
name = "TensorZero"
base_url = "http://localhost:3000"
wire_api = "tensorzero"
```

```bash
chaos --provider tensorzero --model my-function
```

TensorZero has its own inference protocol — explicit `wire_api` required.

### Z.ai (GLM)

Bundled as two separate providers — Z.ai runs distinct endpoints for
pay-per-token API access and the GLM Coding Plan subscription. Both
share the same `ZAI_API_KEY` env var; pick the provider that matches
your billing.

Pay-per-token (standard API):

```bash
export ZAI_API_KEY=your-key
chaos --provider zai --model glm-5.1
```

GLM Coding Plan (subscription):

```bash
export ZAI_API_KEY=your-key
chaos --provider zai-coding --model glm-5.1
```

Z.ai is the international brand for ZhipuAI's GLM models (GLM-5, GLM-5.1).

### DeepSeek

```toml
[model_providers.deepseek]
name = "DeepSeek"
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com/v1"
env_key = "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
```

### Groq

```toml
[model_providers.groq]
name = "Groq"
base_url = "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1"
env_key = "GROQ_API_KEY"
```

### Ollama (local)

```toml
[model_providers.ollama]
name = "Ollama"
base_url = "http://localhost:11434/v1"
```

No `env_key` needed — Ollama runs locally without authentication.

```bash
chaos --provider ollama --model llama3
```

### Anthropic-compatible proxies (MiniMax, Kimi, Z.ai)

Any provider whose base URL contains `anthropic` gets routed to the
Anthropic Messages adapter:

```toml
[model_providers.minimax]
name = "MiniMax"
base_url = "https://api.minimax.io/anthropic"
env_key = "MINIMAX_API_KEY"
```

Prompt caching remains opt-in for compatible endpoints because some providers
reject Anthropic-specific request fields. Set `CHAOS_ANTHROPIC_CACHE_TTL=5m`
or `1h` only when the endpoint supports top-level `cache_control`.

## CONFIGURATION

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | yes | Display name for logs and model selection |
| `base_url` | yes | Provider API endpoint |
| `env_key` | no | Environment variable holding the API key |
| `env_key_instructions` | no | Help text shown when the key is missing |
| `wire_api` | no | `"auto"` (default), `"responses"`, `"chat_completions"`, or `"tensorzero"`. Anthropic is URL-detected and overrides this. |
| `http_headers` | no | Static headers as `{ "Header-Name" = "value" }` |
| `env_http_headers` | no | Headers from env vars as `{ "Header-Name" = "ENV_VAR" }` |
| `query_params` | no | Query string parameters as `{ "key" = "value" }` |
| `request_max_retries` | no | HTTP retry limit (default: 4, max: 100) |
| `stream_max_retries` | no | Stream reconnect limit (default: 5, max: 100) |
| `stream_idle_timeout_ms` | no | Idle timeout in ms (default: 300000) |
| `supports_websockets` | no | Enable WebSocket transport (default: false) |
| `experimental_bearer_token` | no | Hardcoded bearer token (discouraged — use `env_key`) |

## SELECTION RULES

FreeChaOS resolves the wire format in this order:

1. If the `base_url` contains `anthropic` → Anthropic Messages API (overrides `wire_api`)
2. If `wire_api` is set explicitly → use it (`responses`, `chat_completions`, `tensorzero`)
3. Otherwise → `auto`: try Responses, fall back to Chat Completions on 404/405/501

There is no `wire_api = "anthropic"` option. The URL is the signal.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**"env var not set"** — Export the API key variable listed in `env_key`.

**Provider returns errors** — Check that `base_url` points to the correct
API version endpoint. Most OpenAI-compatible providers use `/v1`.

**Timeouts on slow providers** — Increase `stream_idle_timeout_ms`:

```toml
[model_providers.slow]
stream_idle_timeout_ms = 600000
```

**Rate limiting** — FreeChaOS retries 429s automatically. Increase
`request_max_retries` if needed.
